# Frontend Mentor - IP Address Tracker Solution

This is my solution to the [IP address tracker challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0). I'm super thankful to have found Frontend Mentor as a great way to confidently grow in my coding skills with real-life projects.

## Overview

### [Project Brief](./project%20brief/)

Your challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, you'll be using the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, we recommend using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

---

⚠️ **IMPORTANT** ⚠️: To use the IP Geolocation API by IPify, you'll need to sign up for a free account. You won't need to add any cards details to do this and it's a very quick process. This will generate an API Key for you. Usually, you would be able to restrict your API Key to a specific URL (your own domain). This makes sure that other people can't use your API Key on their own websites. IPify doesn't have this feature, but because you aren't adding your card details, this isn't an issue. **So be sure to only sign up for the free account and DO NOT enter any card details**.

For the mapping API, we recommend using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/). It's free to use and doesn't require an API Key. If you decide to use another API, like Google Maps or Mapbox, be sure to secure your API Key. Here are guides for both Google Maps and Mapbox, be sure to read through them thoroughly:

- [API Key best practices from Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/maps/api-key-best-practices)
- [How to use Mapbox securely](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/troubleshooting/how-to-use-mapbox-securely/)

Exposing your API Key publicly can lead to other people using it to make requests for their own application if the proper precautions aren't in place. Please be sure you read the guides thoroughly and follow their recommendations.

**We don't take any responsibility if you expose your API Key while completing the challenge and have not secured it.**

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - React framework
- HTML5
- CSS
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS framework
- Mobile-first workflow
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

### What I learned

When I found out that Tailwind had an intuitive way of switching between light and dark CSS themes, I knew I had to give it a go with this social media dashboard project. Really happy with how this turned out! I approached it by first getting the structure down for the whole page on light theme, and once it was in a good place I adjusted the tailwind.config file to discern the dark theme mode by className. It was simple adjusting the colors and feel by using "dark:" as a prefix in the utility classes, and I put those at the end of each className to keep them consistent spot. Since there was also quite a bit of repetitive code I decided to make separate components for the first four "account cards" and then for the bottom eight "detail cards" to make my code simpler and easier to read and manage. I'm proud of this one and definitely want to keep practicing using themes in Tailwind!

Here are a few code samples from this project:

```html
<!-- 'AccountCard' component for the top row of cards -->

```

```css
/* Importing custom font in my main CSS file */

```

```js

```

### Continued development

As a starter developer, I want to keep growing in working as a team and learning how to deliver smaller packages of code at a time, such as robust and beautiful pages like this one. I thought this project was a good way to get back into React and begin doing just that!

### Useful resources

- [CSS Formatter](http://www.lonniebest.com/FormatCSS/) - I found this helpful site when I'm feeling lazy and don't want to format my CSS code, I can have this do it for me, especially putting everything in alphabetical order.
- [Tailwind Grid](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/grid-template-columns) - Handy guide from Tailwind's docs about using grid-cols to structure content
