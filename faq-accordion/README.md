## Overview

### [Project Brief](./project%20brief/)

Your challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to: 

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

I was not expecting my CSS file to be as long as it is but I greatly appreciated all the little challenges with this project and getting to use semantic HTML and CSS to build. There was the shelves image that needed some specific positioning and size adjustments, the article author row, and especially the button to open up the social links menu. I first tackled the desktop version since I knew I needed some z-indexing and absolute positioning for that links menu, and I used an 'after' pseudo selector for the triangle and positioned that with absolute as well. It wasn't too bad moving into the mobile version and there I added a z-index for the main card button to appear over the links menu when clicked. All said finishing this component took a bit longer than expected but this was great practice, and I definitely want to keep building more projects with the basic tools like in this one. 

Here are a few code samples from this project:

```html
<!-- Card bottom section -->

```

```css
/* Styles for the card bottom */

```

### Continued development

As a starter developer, I want to keep growing in working as a team and learning how to deliver smaller packages of code at a time, such as components like this one. I thought this project was a good way to get back into React and begin doing just that!

### Useful resources

- [CSS Formatter](http://www.lonniebest.com/FormatCSS/) - I found this helpful site when I'm feeling lazy and don't want to format my CSS code, I can have this do it for me, especially putting everything in alphabetical order.
- Brad Traversy's [50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/) - I highly recommend this course for great practice in using just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to build amazing projects.
