# Frontend Mentor - Results Summary Component Solution

This is my solution to the [Results summary component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV). I'm super thankful to have found Frontend Mentor as a great way to confidently grow in my coding skills with real-life projects.

## Overview

### [Project Brief](./project%20brief/)

Your challenge is to build out this results summary component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data for the results in a local `data.json` file. So you can use that to add the results and total score dynamically if you choose.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

This was a great challenge not just to keep practicing creating components from design specs and guidelines, but also using a bit of React JS to make the functionality work. I liked getting to practice hooks and managing state in this one, and handling the submit button click to pop up the result view. I first developed each view one at a time and make sure the design matched up closely, and then devided them up between two Fragment tags, so ultimately a React state would decide which one was rendered, depending on if the form was submitted or not. This was also great practice for lining up multiple buttons in a row, as well as managing spacing and hover states.

Here are a few code samples from this project:

```html

```

```css

```

```js

```

### Continued development

As a starter developer, I want to keep growing in working as a team and learning how to deliver smaller packages of code at a time, such as components like this one. I thought this project was a good way to get back into React and begin doing just that!

### Useful resources

- [CSS Formatter](http://www.lonniebest.com/FormatCSS/) - I found this helpful site when I'm feeling lazy and don't want to format my CSS code, I can have this do it for me, especially putting everything in alphabetical order.
- [CSS Button Generator](https://css3buttongenerator.com) - Quickly make buttons by inputting desired features. This helps as I'm continuing to learn how to make buttons that meet design specs.
