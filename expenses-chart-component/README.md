## Overview

### [Project Brief](./project%20brief/)

Your challenge is to build out this bar chart component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data for the chart in a local `data.json` file. So you can use that to dynamically add the bars if you choose.

Your users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day's bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See dynamically generated bars based on the data provided in the local JSON file

### What I learned

While I greatly enjoy using the various frontend frameworks we have, I wanted to try out a few Frontend Mentor challenges with just basic HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript and first up is this social links profile component. I had been working through one of Brad Traversy's Udemy courses to practice and learn more, and I thought this challenge was perfect - I was surprised how quickly it came together. I focused first on getting the structure down, making use of flex boxes and flex direction, and then tackling each of the profile segments at a time. Using variables at the root level made it simpler to keep track of colors, and I also decided to add some a small scale animation for button clicks to make it more interesting. I definitely want to keep practicing using the basic tools in more projects like this one.

Here are a few code samples from this project:

```html
<!-- Profile card structure -->

```

```css
/* Social button styling */

```

```js
//

```

### Continued development

As a starter developer, I want to keep growing in working as a team and learning how to deliver smaller packages of code at a time, such as components like this one. I thought this project was a good way to get back into React and begin doing just that!

### Useful resources

- [CSS Formatter](http://www.lonniebest.com/FormatCSS/) - I found this helpful site when I'm feeling lazy and don't want to format my CSS code, I can have this do it for me, especially putting everything in alphabetical order.
- Brad Traversy's [50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/) - I highly recommend this course for great practice in using just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to build amazing projects.
