# Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component Solution

This is my solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges are a great way to help improve coding skills by building realistic projects.

### What I learned

I decided to try Frontend Mentor as a way to challenge myself in frontend design and push myself to grow more comfortable and fluent in this stack - and so far I'm loving it! This QR code project was a great way to get familiar with React again as well as some basic CSS styles. Getting the QR image right was the trickiest part; I had to play around with the Bootstrap settings a bit to make sure everything stayed centered. It was a good reminder to keep my styles code cohesive and simple.

Here are some code samples I'm proud of from this project:

```html
<div className="row">
  <div className="qr-box"></div>
</div>
```

```css
.qr-box {
	background-image: url(assets/image-qr-code.png);
	background-position: center center;
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
	background-size: cover;
	border-radius: 10px;
	min-height: 250px;
}
```

### Continued development

As a starter developer, I want to keep growing in working as a team and learning how to deliver smaller packages of code at a time, such as components like this one. I thought this project was a good way to get back into React and begin doing just that!

### Useful resources

- [Taking screenshots on Safari for Mac](https://eshop.macsales.com/blog/76508-take-a-screenshot-of-an-entire-webpage/) - This was a helpful way I found to take screenshots on Safari for Mac. Another way I'll use is to print a page to PDF, and then convert to .jpg or .png format.
- [CSS Box Shadows](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - These are a helpful set of box-shadow styles with a wide variety of styles. This is one of those settings I'm coming to grips with so this is a great way to find one to start off with and then modify as needed.
