# Frontend Mentor Project Solutions

This is a collection of solutions I created for a variety of challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) - a platform that provides an awesome way to grow in frontend development skills. I really enjoy how each project's approach is a lot like a real-life scenario: you're given a brief that contains core design goals and styles, sometimes Sketch or Figma files for a greater level of detail, and then it's up to you to deliver a solution that as closely matches what's needed as possible. There is a lot of flexibility to build however you want. Each one of these projects within this showcase pushed me for different reasons, to stretch what I thought I was capable of, and to challenge me to keep learning and growing - aiming to get better everyday with practice.

Check out links below for each project's live demo, my Frontend Mentor solution, and the original project brief's link.
